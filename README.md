##What is a database?
Da•ta•base
_noun_

* Stores data in an organized, logical manner.
* Buzzwords:
 - schema
 - table
 - primary key
 - query
 - SQL
 - object-relational-mapping (ORM)

###Database Basics
* Data arranged in a schema, or a defined plan to store data. (E.g. keys, types, requirements, validation, etc.)
* Tables are like a spreadsheet table, consisting of rows and columns. Rows are entries and columns are the fields for the rows.
* Each table will have a primary key column which stores a unique value in order to find records quickly.
* A query is a statement used to indicate to the database which data to fetch.
* Object-relational mapping (ORM)  is a technique used to map between Object-Oriented programming and databases.
* SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the predominant language used to query databases. (High learning curve.)
* NoSQL is a rebellion against the high order of the SQL gods, MySQL, PostgresQL, and others. (Low learning curve.)

##Proposal

Flask + MongoDB

###Flask (web framework)
* Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. 
* It is extremely light weight.
* Only takes 10 minutes to start processing requests.
* Used by Pinterest and LinkedIn.

Creating an app is incredibly simple: see [here](https://github.com/jadar/TryFlask/blob/master/app.py).

###Strengths
* Flask
 - Extremely lightweight
 - Customizable
 - Well documented
 - Doesn't require tons of maintenance. 
 - Written in Python.
* MongoDB
 - NoSQL, literally no SQL necessary.
 - Already in use locally, we can create a new store or use the existing one.
